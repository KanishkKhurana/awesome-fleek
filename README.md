Fleek is an edge-optimized, onchain cloud platform. Fleek algorithmically operates a global network of web infrastructure operators (called nodes) to create a superior cloud platform for developers to run their software and applications on. With Fleek you get permissionless, high performance, edge-optimized, auto-scalable infrastructure out of the box, and at a lower cost than centralzied counterparts.

This repo aims to collect community explorations on Fleek Network and build creative usecases that can benefit developers, projects and companies. It is an open space to discuss ideas, jam on technical architectures and figure problems out.
